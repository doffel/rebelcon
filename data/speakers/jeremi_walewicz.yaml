He specialises in improving processes and consistently meeting user expectations. Prior to joining DesignWizard Jeremi worked on a wide variety of software projects internationally including... His unending quest is to increase the usability of the product, application and website. He also continues to code describing seeing his designs brought to life as ‘the best feeling’. Jeremi loves harnessing the power of animation, implementing CSS3 features in his workflows to bring users fun and joy on their journeys. He also loves travel, sports and web design, he counts himself lucky to be able to enjoy all three at DesignWizard.."
